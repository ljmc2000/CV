Soothing Noise Player:
  description: On desktop there is an application called blanket which allows mixing and matching various sound effects both included with the app and imported from the filesystem. I felt this would be useful to have on the go and so made an android application, borrowing some icons and public domain sound effects (with the original author's blessing). It runs completely offline, all sounds loop seemlessly and the apk comes in at only 6 megabytes. I've added various features such as a sleep timer overtime by user request.

Chessboard2Net:
  description: A rewrite of Chessboard.Net in node and AngularJS with additional features such as custom colours on pieces, the storing and playback of replays, spectating in progress matches, all rules of chess working as expected and the entire additional game of checkers.
