- I developed and maintain an open source android application called <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/ie.delilahsthings.soothingloop/">Soothing Noise Player</a> with over 25 stars on GitHub
- Former co-workers still sometimes message me to ask about technical challenges they have months after my leaving
- I won a prize for an android assignment which was "to a higher standard than some final year projects [the lecturer] had graded"
